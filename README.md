Files comparing CSS4 Grid with Flexbox and float-based layouts.

start.html may be paired with either float.css or flexbox.css. The look of the page is similar with minor differences in spacing.

start-grid.html is paired with grid.css. The HTML is different as no "row" feature is required, as it is with float or flexbox-based systems.

basic.css contains non-layout CSS: colors, padding, fonts, etc. This also contains a border-box declaration for ease of working with layouts.
